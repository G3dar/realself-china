For the recommended large venue (350 capacity), approximately 1000m² is required with experience space of 26m x 18m and 350m² changing room. Both include foyer, control room (15m²), and storage."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "How many projectors are needed?",
        "answer": "Small venue (150 capacity) requires 18 projectors, while large venue (350 capacity) needs 36 projectors. These are ceiling-mounted, high-lumen projectors (6,500-12,000 ANSI lumens) that provide full floor and wall coverage for the immersive projections. You'll need a Disguise or Watchout video server system with 18 or 36 outputs respectively."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "Can I use my existing venue?",
        "answer": "Possibly! The key requirements are: sufficient floor area, minimum 5m ceiling height, ability to achieve complete blackout, and strong climate control. Warehouses, event halls, and theater spaces often work well. We evaluate each venue individually."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "What if my ceiling is less than 5m?",
        "answer": "Ceiling height below 5m significantly limits projection coverage and the immersive quality. We may be able to adapt with different projector configurations, but this requires individual assessment. The ideal is 9m for optimal floor projection distance."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "Who provides the equipment?",
        "answer": "The partner provides all AV equipment (projectors, media servers, sound system, lighting). Real Self provides technical supervision, content, projection mapping design, and show control programming. We work with your local AV team during installation."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "How long does installation take?",
        "answer": "Full installation takes approximately 20 days. This includes equipment installation, projection mapping and calibration, sound setup, staff training, and technical rehearsals. Our team of 2-4 people will be on-site throughout."
